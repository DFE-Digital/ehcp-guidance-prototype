        <p class="govuk-body-s">From: Department for Education</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-s">Published: 29 November 2023</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-s">Updated: 1 December 2023</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">This guidance is to help local authorities improve their use of digital systems to
          improve their management of education, health and care plan (EHCP) processes.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use the guidance to help you consider how systems: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>support the recording, tracking and analysis of education, health and care plans</li>
            <li>are procured, set up and managed</li>
            <li>interact with other systems to share information and link services together</li>
            <li>can be monitored and measured to identify opportunities for improvement of the system, professional practices or the service</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that may conflict, such as: </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>the needs of the people who use the system (based on research with them)</li>
              <li>meeting data capture and reporting needs</li>
              <li>delivering efficiency, quality and value for money</li>
              <li>monitoring the service and performance reporting</li>
              <li>meeting legal duties to report and share information</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">They also need to be delivered within budget and resource planning limits
              and be flexible in response to changing needs and requirements.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Whilst digital technology and the use of systems can create efficiencies and better oversight,
              they can only work well when developed and embedded into your ways of working.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Consider taking external specialist advice to help you at the different stages of procurement and development
              to make sure you have the knowledge and support you need.
              You should also manage your system over time, and do regular health checks to make sure it continues to work in an optimal way.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Systems, whether purchased or developed in-house, should be designed, configured, implemented and managed based on the
        needs of your individual EHCP processes, your partners and your users. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that may conflict, such as: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>meeting legal duties to report and share information</li>
          </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">To make the best use of digital systems and technology, you should:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>identify the service’s vision and goals</li>
          <li>assess how existing systems use data and how you want to use it in future</li>
          <li>understand how users interact with existing systems</li>
          <li>identify barriers and ways digital services can better meet people’s needs</li>
          <li>identify problems and needs</li>
          <li>map desired outcomes to your vision and goals</li>
          <li>make sure people are engaged and understand the vision and goals</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">Before seeking solution, you need to have an understanding of:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>how your EHCP processes and systems have developed over time</li>
          <li>your existing infrastructure</li>
          <li>what you want your service to achieve</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">It is important that IT teams and those who understand the local authority's ambitions for the EHCP service work together
          to plan digital systems that enable the service vision. Having conversations about visions and goals with potential suppliers ahead of any
          procurement exercise will help you to understand what options may be on offer.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A user is anyone who uses the system directly or uses information from the system.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should consider how your system will help frontline users meet the needs of children, young people and families.
        Take account of users’ individual needs such as different locations, digital skills and accessibility requirements.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Think about who your users are and speak to them to understand what they need from the system. Your users might include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>social workers</li>
      <li>service delivery managers</li>
      <li>data analysts</li>

      <li>the experience of professionals, children, young people and families</li>
      <li>the skills and abilities of the different users of the system</li>

      <li>how the outputs will be used, for example, reporting to the Department for Education (DfE) or preparing for an Ofsted inspection</li>
      <li>interaction with other systems, such as social care, health and education systems</li>
      <li>the ability to make improvements to EHCP services by using data from the system to spot trends, gaps and make predictions</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">EHCP systems should be developed in response to the changing needs of users and service developments.
        You should regularly work with developers and suppliers to assess the design, configuration and performance of systems against user needs,
        and ensure the assessments inform future versions.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should also aim to understand what might stop users from making the most of a system, such as training or time
          to change their ways of working, ahead of launching new services or features.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can learn about the problems users face by:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>using data analytics and other available data to identify where there may be a problem</li>
        <li>using methods such as surveys, group workshops and feedback loops to support your understanding</li>
        <li>using test environments to assess hypotheses and functionality in ‘live’ practice</li>
        <li>engaging with suppliers, for example, through their reference groups or workshops</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Consider how you'll gather insights and feedback from users to make sure any new needs are identified and met.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When reviewing the need for a new system, upgrade or development you should consider the needs of different users within the service,
        local authority and wider community. You should make sure you have clearly identified all those who use the system or its outputs.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the design, local configuration and implementation will be tested and iterated to ensure it continues to meet user needs</li>
        <li>input from professionals, families, young people and other service users has been used to design and configure the system</li>
        <li>user needs have been balanced with the business and technical needs of the system</li>
        <li>the system provides easy access to information</li>
        <li>it supports users to accurately capture quality data</li>
        <li>the system or development will support the service’s vision and goals and be focused on specific outcomes</li>
        <li>accessibility, permissions and restrictions for people using the system, both within the local authority as well as external partners</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should work with suppliers to test and iterate systems, updates and developments, ahead of implementation.
        This will help to ensure that the design and configuration can be improved over time based on user feedback.
        Make sure there's time in your project plan to do this.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">It is useful to frame user needs as problems to be solved and the desired outcomes. Then do a separate exercise
          to map how potential options could resolve the problems to achieve those outcomes. Engage suppliers and developers to work together
          to assess the problems and any solution based desired outcomes.</p>
